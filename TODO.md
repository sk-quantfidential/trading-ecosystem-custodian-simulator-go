## epic-TSE-0001: Foundation Services & Infrastructure

### üß™ Milestone TSE-0001.4.1: Custodian Testing Suite
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Owner**: custodian-data-adapter-go
**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.4 (Data Adapters) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Add comprehensive BDD behavior tests to custodian-data-adapter-go following audit-data-adapter-go pattern

**Scope**:
- BDD test framework with Given/When/Then pattern
- Position, Settlement, Balance repository tests
- Service discovery and cache tests
- Integration and comprehensive test suites
- Performance testing with configurable thresholds
- CI/CD ready with automatic environment detection

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ tests/README.md created with comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Makefile enhanced with audit-data-adapter-go testing targets
- ‚è≥ Test suites passing with >90% success rate
- ‚è≥ Test coverage >80% for all repository implementations
- ‚è≥ Integration tests validating full custodian workflows

**Documentation**: See custodian-data-adapter-go/TODO.md for detailed implementation plan

**Note**: This epic enables comprehensive testing before TSE-0001.6 (Custodian Foundation) implementation

### üè¶ Milestone TSE-0001.6: Custodian Foundation (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.4.1 (Custodian Testing Suite) üöß
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Enables settlement and custody

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Account custody simulation (hold balances across assets)
- [ ] Settlement processing (T+0 immediate settlements initially)
- [ ] Transfer API (deposits/withdrawals between accounts)
- [ ] Balance reporting and reconciliation
- [ ] Multi-asset custody support (BTC, ETH, USD, USDT)
- [ ] Settlement instruction processing
- [ ] Custody audit trail
- [ ] Basic compliance checks

**BDD Acceptance**: Exchange settlements flow through to custodian accounts

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3b (Go Services gRPC Integration) ‚úÖ, TSE-0001.4 (Data Adapters) ‚úÖ, TSE-0001.5b (Exchange Order Processing)

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12b: Trading Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integration with exchange settlement validation
- [ ] Multi-day settlement cycle testing
- [ ] Balance reconciliation across services
- [ ] Chaos scenario participation (settlement delays, failures)

**BDD Acceptance**: Complete trading flow works end-to-end with risk monitoring

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.8 (Trading Engine), TSE-0001.6 (Custodian)

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Settlement Types**: Start with T+0, design for T+1, T+2 cycles
- **Production API**: REST endpoints that exchanges and risk monitors will use
- **Audit API**: Separate endpoints for chaos injection and internal state
- **Multi-Asset**: Support major crypto and fiat currencies
- **Compliance**: Basic AML/KYC simulation, extensible for real requirements
- **Chaos Ready**: Design for controlled settlement failures

---

## Future Enhancements (Post TSE-0001.4)

### Service Layer Enhancement
- [ ] Update CustodianService to use DataAdapter repositories for business logic
- [ ] Implement position management endpoints (create, query, lock, unlock)
- [ ] Implement settlement workflow endpoints (initiate, complete, cancel)
- [ ] Implement balance operations endpoints (deposit, withdraw, transfer)
- [ ] Add gRPC service definitions for inter-service communication

### Testing
- [ ] Implement BDD integration tests for DataAdapter connectivity
- [ ] Add unit tests for service layer with mock repositories
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for custodian workflows
- [ ] Add performance tests for concurrent operations
- [ ] Implement chaos testing for infrastructure failures

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics for DataAdapter operations
- [ ] Implement OpenTelemetry tracing for database queries
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for custodian operations
- [ ] Add alerting for connection pool exhaustion
- [ ] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs

### Resilience
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for database operations
- [ ] Add exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Implement automatic reconnection on connection loss
- [ ] Add bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- [ ] Create fallback strategies for degraded mode
