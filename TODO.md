### üèóÔ∏è Milestone TSE-0001.1a: Go Services Bootstrapping
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create Go service directory structure following clean architecture
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (REST and gRPC)
- [x] Basic structured logging with levels
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Dockerfile for service containerization
- [x] Load component-specific .claude configuration

**BDD Acceptance**: All Go services can start, respond to health checks, and shutdown gracefully

### üîó Milestone TSE-0001.3b: Go Services gRPC Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement gRPC server with health service
- [ ] Service registration with Redis-based discovery
- [ ] Configuration service client integration
- [ ] Inter-service communication testing

**BDD Acceptance**: Go services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1a (Go Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

### üè¶ Milestone TSE-0001.6: Custodian Foundation (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Enables settlement and custody

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Account custody simulation (hold balances across assets)
- [ ] Settlement processing (T+0 immediate settlements initially)
- [ ] Transfer API (deposits/withdrawals between accounts)
- [ ] Balance reporting and reconciliation
- [ ] Multi-asset custody support (BTC, ETH, USD, USDT)
- [ ] Settlement instruction processing
- [ ] Custody audit trail
- [ ] Basic compliance checks

**BDD Acceptance**: Exchange settlements flow through to custodian accounts

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3b (Go Services gRPC Integration), TSE-0001.5b (Exchange Order Processing)

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12b: Trading Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integration with exchange settlement validation
- [ ] Multi-day settlement cycle testing
- [ ] Balance reconciliation across services
- [ ] Chaos scenario participation (settlement delays, failures)

**BDD Acceptance**: Complete trading flow works end-to-end with risk monitoring

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.8 (Trading Engine), TSE-0001.6 (Custodian)

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Settlement Types**: Start with T+0, design for T+1, T+2 cycles
- **Production API**: REST endpoints that exchanges and risk monitors will use
- **Audit API**: Separate endpoints for chaos injection and internal state
- **Multi-Asset**: Support major crypto and fiat currencies
- **Compliance**: Basic AML/KYC simulation, extensible for real requirements
- **Chaos Ready**: Design for controlled settlement failures
